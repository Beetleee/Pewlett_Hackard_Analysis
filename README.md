### by Terra Lasho 

## Summary: 
For this project I utilized pgAdmin4 to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in mentorship program using several criteria.  This is for Bobby’s manager to help prepare for retirees.
## Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title:
### Create Retirement Titles table for employees born between Jan 1, 1952- Dec 31, 1955.

### Overview of Analysis:
In this analysis, Bobby needs to determine the number of retirees per title in the company, and identify the ones who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
### Results:

-	Job title breakdowns include:

- 32,452 Staff

- 14,221 Engineer
- 8,047 Senior Staff
- 4,502 Technique Leader
- 1,761 Assistant Engineer
### Summary:
#### 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” approaches
#### No, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees ready to mentor the next gen of PH employees.
