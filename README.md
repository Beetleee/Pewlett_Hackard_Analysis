# Module 7 Challenge Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
### by Terra Lasho 

## Summary: 
For this project I utilized pgAdmin4 to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in mentorship program using several criteria.  This is for Bobby’s manager to help prepare for retirees.
## Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title:
### Create Retirement Titles table for employees born between Jan 1, 1952- Dec 31, 1955.

## Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis:
### Overview of Analysis:
In this analysis, Bobby needs to determine the number of retirees per title in the company, and identify the ones who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
### Results:
-	A large proportion of employees could retire at anytime! HP needs to prepare...
-	Job title breakdowns include:

- 32,452 Staff
- 29,415 Senior Engineer
- 14,221 Engineer
- 8,047 Senior Staff
- 4,502 Technique Leader
- 1,761 Assistant Engineer
### Summary:
#### 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” approaches
#### There are 1,940 qualified, retirement-ready employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program, not enough to cover HP's needs.
